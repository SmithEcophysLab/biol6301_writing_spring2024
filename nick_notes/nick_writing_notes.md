## exercise 2.1
- overview
	- roots act differently than the rest of the plant
	- root spectrum occurs in all aboveground plants (across their spectrum)
	- aboveground is 2-d and roots are 2-d (but not matching)
- did authors do a good job?
	- yes, they hit all of those points!
- how far along from data to understanding
	- somewhere in the middle
	- it was a lot of data and the interpretation was mostly speculative
	- did not necessarilly provide a new theory to improve understanding
	- "hand-wavey"
- could they have taken it further?
	- maybe, but it was already long and complex
	- follow-up paper used to build understanding?
	- also an issue with use trait datasets >> definite patterns, but mechanisms aren't clear!

## exercise 2.2
### step 1
1. opening
	- humans are emitting fossil fuels, increasing atmospheric co2, causing climate change
	- photosynthesis is the only way to get co2 out of the atmosphere
	- we don't know why photosynthesis acclimates to co2 in the way it does
	- models don't include photosynthetic acclimation to co2
	- there are multiple competing hypotheses for this
	- the competing hypotheses have different predictions for plant-co2 relations and
	climate change in the future
2. specific question/hypothesis
	- the competing theories about photosynthetic responses to co2 can be reconciled
	into a single theory by taking a plant-centric approach rather than a passive
	plant approach
3. key results
	- the theories are not mutually exclusive
	- the theories can be reconciled using a plant-centric approach
4. main conclusion
	- photosynthesis acclimates to co2 by conserving resources
	- this can be predicted via a plant centric approach
	- the saved resources can be used to support other process
	- consideration of this reconciled theory can improve ESMs

### step 2
Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have risen steadily over the past 
century as a result of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions and land use change.
Annual mean values of atmospheric CO2 recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory 
have increased from 316.0 µmol mol-1 in 1960 to 418.5 µmol mol-1 in 2022. 
Terrestrial photosynthesis represents the largest flux of CO2 between the atmosphere
and the Earth's surface. This flux drives the land carbon sink, which
offsets roughly 30% of anthropogenic emissions.
However, state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) do not agree on how this sink will vary under
future global change, with some models predicting an increase in the strength of the sink
and others predicting a decrease, with some even suggesting that the land surface will
become a source for CO2 by the end of the century.
Much of the discrepancy in model projections is a result of their representation of photosynthesis.
Atmospheric CO2 is the substrate for photosynthesis and plants typically respond
by increasing photosynthesis in response to an increase in atmospheric CO2 over short
and long time scales. However, plants are known to acclimate their photosynthetic traits in
response to changes in CO2, a process that is generally omitted from ESMs. 
For instance, experimental data consistently indicate that leaf photosynthetic capacity 
of C3 plants decreases with increasing atmospheric CO2, despite consistently
displaying faster rates of carbon assimilation. 
However, there are multiple competing hypotheses for the mechanisms underlying this response. 
Two of the most widely cited are (1) CO2-induced nutrient limitation of photosynthetic 
capacity and (2) optimal down regulation of photosynthetic capacity under elevated CO2.
The nutrient limitation hypothesis suggests that the downregulation is the product of nutrient depletion
in soils, which is commonly observed in elevated CO2 experiments. The reasoning follows that,
because the enzymes that underlie photosynthetic capacity require relatively large amounts
of nutrients to build and maintain, the nutrient depletion in the soil directly limits photosynthetic
capacity. The optimal downregulation hypothesis suggests that plants reduce investment in photosynthetic
enzymes (namely, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carbocylase/oxygenase or RuBisCO), as maintenance
of high photosynthetic rates can be achieved with less RuBisCO investment under elevated CO2. 
While not mutually exclusive, these two hypotheses imply differential effects of 
ongoing and expected future increases in atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem carbon and 
nutrient cycling and, thus, feedbacks to climate.
Here, we resolve these competing hypotheses. 
We find that, while nutrient limitation does often  limit the stimulation of 
biomass productivity under elevated CO2, the reduction in photosynthetic capacity can predominantly 
be explained by optimal biochemical downregulation. Importantly, the support for 
optimal downregulation indicates that photosynthetic nutrient use efficiency increases 
under elevated atmospheric CO2 and, thus, reduces the rate and magnitude of 
progressive nutrient limitation to plant biomass productivity. 
Optimal downregulation of photosynthetic capacity under elevated CO2 is not 
currently, but should be included in the next generation of terrestrial biosphere models 
in order to accurately project changes in future terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling.
Recent developments have produced reliable formulas to simulate optimal downregulation
of photosynthetic capacity under elevated CO2 that can be introduced to ESMs without
increasing parametric uncertainty.

### step 3
SKIPPING AND INTEGRATING INTO EXERCISE 3.2

## exercise 3.1
- simple
	- the idea itself is very complicated, but the results were made simple
		- many species with similar root syndromes have different AG syndromes
		- good job with abstract
		- PCAs are generally a good "simple" way to explain things
- unexpected
	- AG syndrome doesn't equal BG syndrome is very unexpected!
- concrete
	- here's where things break down a bit
	- so abstract an idea that it is not super concrete
- credible
	- huge new dataset with sophisticated analyses = credible
	- but suffers a bit from concreteness
- emotional
	- doesn't really hit this
	- although examples help with this (I can relate to these!)
- stories
	- similar story throughout, just told a different way
	- multiple packages would have been helpful I think

## exercise 3.2 (evan critique)
- simple
	- it's easier to understand, but not simple
		- not sure how to say that, but there is just a lot going on (technical words and such)
		- starting with a simpler schema (maybe more in the beginning) may have helped
- unexpected
	- the expectation for the measured traits was not set up
	- however, the "we don't know how allelopathic invasion" really works was set up well!
- concrete
	- this was great I think
	- the points were solid and the results were direct
- credible
	- yes, absolutely, but this may have pulled from the simplicity a bit
	- I think more "simple" sentences could be added in
- emotional
	- not much emotion
	- some broader context may help here
		- how widespread are allelopathic invaders?
		- what is their broader impact?
		- how does this fit into a larger context?
- stories
	- the story was clear!
	- there was a good flow
	- adding to the "simple" and "emotional" element would help with this
